## Project Description:

-Prepared data by performing various operations such as data type conversion, filtering, sorting, and handling duplicate and missing values to ensure the data was ready for further analysis.

-Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the movie dataset, using visualization techniques like histograms and scatter plots to identify data distribution and relationships between variables.

-Applied feature engineering techniques by processing and selecting relevant features using methods like join and aggregate, which were then used as inputs for Machine Learning models.

-Split the data into training and test sets, and implemented holdout validation and cross-validation techniques to ensure the model could generalize well to new data.

-Studied and built supervised learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree, for classification in movie analysis. Trained and tested the models using the prepared data.

-Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, as well as calculating the false positive rate (FPR) and using the ROC AUC score to assess overall model performance.
